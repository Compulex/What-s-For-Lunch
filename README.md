# What-s-For-Lunch

A sequence of options for lunch meals starting with the main course, sides, the sauce that comes with the side or the side's flavor, and a beverage. Can be chosen in any order. Animation is added using Javascript to display or change to the proceeding question. 

Next Steps:1. Remove multiple divs when changing earlier option
2. Fix order of string that displays what the user ordered

Current Issues: 
Choosing different option from preceding question then displaying the removal of the multiple selects
Slide animation not working for last div id='drinks' when changing previous option
